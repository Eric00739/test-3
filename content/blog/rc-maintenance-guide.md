Your device's battery is its lifeline. Proper battery care is essential for performance and longevity:

### Lithium-Polymer (LiPo) Batteries

**Storage Guidelines:**
- Store at 50% charge when not in use for extended periods
- Keep in a cool, dry place (15-25°C)
- Use fire-proof storage containers for safety

**Charging Best Practices:**
```bash
# Example charging parameters
- Charge Rate: 1C (or manufacturer specified)
- Balance Charge: Always use balance charging
- Temperature: Do not charge below 0°C or above 45°C
- Never Leave Unattended: Monitor charging process
```

**Usage Tips:**
- Allow batteries to cool before recharging
- Avoid deep discharge (stop at 20% capacity)
- Replace batteries showing signs of puffing or damage

### Battery Health Monitoring

Create a battery log to track performance:

| Battery ID | Purchase Date | Cycles | Internal Resistance | Notes |
|------------|---------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Lipo-001   | 2024-01-15    | 45     | 3.2mΩ               | Good  |
| Lipo-002   | 2024-03-20    | 23     | 2.8mΩ               | Excellent |

## Motor and Drivetrain Maintenance

   - Use motor-specific lubricants only

### Brushless Motors

1. **Inspection**
   - Check for bent or damaged shafts
   - Inspect windings for discoloration
   - Verify secure mounting

2. **Cleaning**
   - Use soft brush to remove dirt
   - Avoid water or harsh chemicals
   - Compressed air for internal cleaning

### Drivetrain Components

**Gears and Transmission:**
- Check for worn teeth or damage
- Clean and re-grease regularly
- Adjust gear mesh for optimal performance

**Differentials:**
- Change differential oil per manufacturer schedule
- Check for leaks or damage
- Adjust slipper clutch if equipped

## Electronics Care
