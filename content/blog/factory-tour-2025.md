Our Surface Mount Technology (SMT) production line represents the pinnacle of modern electronics manufacturing. Featuring the **Panasonic NPM-W2** high-speed mounter, our facility achieves:

- **Capacity**: 50,000 components per hour
- **Yield Rate**: 99.8% first-pass success
- **Precision**: ±0.025mm placement accuracy

The automated optical inspection (AOI) systems ensure every component is perfectly placed before moving to the next stage, guaranteeing the reliability our customers expect.

## Quality Control: Zero Defect Philosophy

Quality isn't just a checkpoint—it's embedded in every step of our process. Our 3D AOI systems with machine learning capabilities detect defects that human eyes might miss:

### Multi-Stage Inspection Process

1. **Incoming Material Inspection**: Every component undergoes rigorous testing before entering production
2. **In-Process Quality Checks**: Real-time monitoring at each critical stage
3. **Final Product Testing**: Comprehensive functionality and stress testing
4. **Statistical Process Control**: Continuous improvement through data analysis

> "Our zero-defect philosophy means we don't just meet standards—we exceed them consistently."

## Advanced Testing Laboratory

Our RF testing laboratory is equipped with the **Keysight N9030B** spectrum analyzer, capable of 26.5 GHz analysis. This enables us to:

- Perform comprehensive signal integrity testing
- Validate frequency response and power output
- Ensure regulatory compliance across global markets
- Conduct environmental stress testing

### Testing Capabilities

| Test Type | Equipment | Frequency Range | Standards |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| RF Performance | Keysight N9030B | 9kHz - 26.5GHz | FCC, CE, IC |
| Environmental | Climatic Chambers | -40°C to +85°C | IEC 60068 |
| Vibration | Shaker Tables | 5-2000Hz | MIL-STD-810 |
| EMI/EMC | EMI Receiver | 9kHz - 6GHz | CISPR 16 |

## Assembly Line: Precision Meets Efficiency
