# Bug Report - Homepage Optimization

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Metadata Export in Client Component ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The page.tsx file was exporting metadata while also using client-side hooks (useState, useEffect), which is not allowed in Next.js App Router.

**Solution**: 
- Split the page into a server component (page.tsx) that only exports metadata
- Created a new client component (HomeClient.tsx) that contains all the client-side logic
- The server component now just renders the client component

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Converted to server component
- `src/app/[locale]/HomeClient.tsx` - New client component with all the logic

### 2. i18n Fallback System ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Missing translations for non-English locales could cause build failures.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `src/i18n/get-messages.ts` to fallback to English when a locale is missing
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/i18n/get-messages.ts`

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The GitHub Actions workflow was missing the `id: pages` for the configure-pages action.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper `id: pages` to the configure-pages action
- Removed unnecessary `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### 4. Dynamic Import Types ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: TypeScript errors with dynamic imports of components.

**Solution**: 
- Updated dynamic imports to properly extract the default export
- Added proper typing for all dynamic imports

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/[locale]/HomeClient.tsx`

## Potential Issues to Monitor

### 1. Component Props
**Risk**: Some dynamically imported components might not receive the correct props.

**Monitoring**: Check console for any prop-related warnings or errors.

### 2. Image Loading
**Risk**: Images might not load correctly with the new structure.

**Monitoring**: Verify all images load properly, especially the factory montage image in HeroTrustSection.

### 3. Scroll Position
**Risk**: The QuickNav might not correctly track scroll position after dynamic loading.

**Monitoring**: Test QuickNav functionality after all sections are loaded.

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
**Risk**: New component structure might have mobile responsiveness issues.

**Monitoring**: Test on various mobile screen sizes.
