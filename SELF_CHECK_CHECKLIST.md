## 🚨 Critical Issues to Watch

1. **Metadata Export Location**
   - Ensure metadata is in page.tsx (server component), not client components
   - Verify no metadata exports in "use client" files

2. **i18n Build Failures**
   - Confirm fallback system works for all missing locales
   - Test with different language routes

3. **Dynamic Import Types**
   - Verify all dynamic imports properly typed
   - Check loading states render correctly

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Priority loading for hero images
   - Lazy loading for below-fold images
   - WebP format where supported

5. **Bundle Size**
   - Check for duplicate imports
   - Verify code splitting is working
   - Analyze largest chunks
